# Report Purchase Implementation - Summary

## ✅ **CORRECTED IMPLEMENTATION**

The report purchase functionality has been successfully updated to properly align with the smart contract, enabling businesses to purchase vending machine data insights at different time granularities.

## 🔧 **Key Changes Made**

### 1. **Updated Report Model** (`report.model.ts`)
- ✅ Added `ReportType` enum: `Daily`, `Weekly`, `Monthly`
- ✅ Added `reportType` field to interface and schema
- ✅ Added `timeframeDays` field to interface and schema
- ✅ Added `getReportPrice()` function matching smart contract pricing
- ✅ Added validation for timeframe (1-365 days)

### 2. **Updated Report Controller** (`report.controller.ts`)
- ✅ Changed API to accept `reportType` and `timeframeDays` instead of manual `amount`
- ✅ Added automatic price calculation based on report type
- ✅ Added comprehensive validation for all inputs
- ✅ Auto-generates `reportId` based on timestamp and reference
- ✅ Returns all relevant information in response

### 3. **Pricing Structure** (Matching Smart Contract)
```typescript
Daily:   1,000,000 units (1 USDC)
Weekly:  5,000,000 units (5 USDC)  
Monthly: 20,000,000 units (20 USDC)
```

## 📋 **Smart Contract Alignment**

| Smart Contract | Backend API | Status |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| `report_type: ReportType` | `reportType: ReportType` | ✅ Aligned |
| `timeframe_days: u8` | `timeframeDays: number` | ✅ Aligned |
| `get_report_price(report_type)` | `getReportPrice(reportType)` | ✅ Aligned |
| Daily = 1,000,000 | Daily = 1,000,000 | ✅ Aligned |
| Weekly = 5,000,000 | Weekly = 5,000,000 | ✅ Aligned |
| Monthly = 20,000,000 | Monthly = 20,000,000 | ✅ Aligned |

## 🎯 **Business Value Delivered**

### **Before (Broken)**
- ❌ No report type selection
- ❌ Manual amount input (error-prone)
- ❌ No timeframe specification
- ❌ No automatic pricing
- ❌ Misaligned with smart contract

### **After (Fixed)**
- ✅ Clear report type selection (Daily/Weekly/Monthly)
- ✅ Automatic price calculation
- ✅ Timeframe specification (1-365 days)
- ✅ Perfect smart contract alignment
- ✅ Business-friendly API design

## 🚀 **Usage Examples**

### Daily Insights (1 USDC)
```bash
curl -X POST /api/report/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "buyerWallet": "8x7K2mN9pQ4rT5vL3sH6jW1eY8uI0oP7a",
    "reportType": "Daily",
    "timeframeDays": 1
  }'
```

### Weekly Insights (5 USDC)
```bash
curl -X POST /api/report/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "buyerWallet": "8x7K2mN9pQ4rT5vL3sH6jW1eY8uI0oP7a",
    "reportType": "Weekly",
    "timeframeDays": 7
  }'
```

### Monthly Insights (20 USDC)
```bash
curl -X POST /api/report/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "buyerWallet": "8x7K2mN9pQ4rT5vL3sH6jW1eY8uI0oP7a",
    "reportType": "Monthly",
    "timeframeDays": 30
  }'
```

## 🎉 **Result**

The implementation now correctly enables:
- **Businesses** to purchase vending machine data insights
- **Different granularities** (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Automatic pricing** based on data type
- **Perfect alignment** with smart contract functionality
- **Clear API design** for external integrations

The core value proposition is now fully realized: **external entities can buy vending machine data for business insights at different time periods with proper pricing and smart contract integration.**
